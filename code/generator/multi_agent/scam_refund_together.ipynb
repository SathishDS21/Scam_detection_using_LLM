The verification fee is a one-time payment that will be deducted from your refund, so you'll still receive $378.00.

We've identified an overpayment of $487.92 on your account, and we're willing to refund the excess amount.

My colleague, Karen, has already taken down the necessary details, but we still need to complete the verification process. The small fee of $25 is a standard requirement for refunds of this nature.

      "(laughs) Ah, you know it, Rachel! I'm always looking for a good deal. Okay, okay, I'm convinced. You've got a sweet deal here. My routing number is 123456789, and my account number is 9876543210. But, let me ask you, is there any way to get the refund and gift card expedited? I'd love to get my hands on that money as soon as possible. Can you make it happen?\n",

      "(laughs) You're a pleasure to work with, Mr. Johnson! I can definitely arrange for expedited processing. However, there is a small verification fee of $49.99 to ensure that the refund and gift card are processed correctly. This is a one-time fee, and it will guarantee that you receive your refund and gift card within the next 24 hours. Would you like to proceed with the expedited processing, and I'll take care of the rest?\n",

      "(laughs) Excellent decision, Mr. Johnson! I'll go ahead and process the expedited refund and gift card. To confirm, I'll need you to transfer the $49.99 verification fee to our secure account. Can you please transfer the funds using Western Union to our agent's name, Rachel Lee, and the transfer code is 1234? Once I receive the confirmation, I'll ensure that the refund and gift card are credited to your account within the next 24 hours.\n",
