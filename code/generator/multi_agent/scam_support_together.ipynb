This is an incredible value, considering the level of service and expertise you'll be getting. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and get your computer fixed today?\n",

They may not have the expertise to handle this type of advanced virus, and they could end up making the problem worse. In fact, we've seen cases where local shops have actually caused more damage to the computer, resulting in even more expensive repairs. With us, you're dealing with a team of certified experts who specialize in this type of issue. We have the latest tools and technology to fix the problem quickly and correctly.

First, I need you to allow me to remotely access your computer so I can diagnose the problem and remove the virus. I'll need you to download a small program that will allow me to access your system. It's completely safe and secure, I assure you. Once I have access, I'll be able to remove the malware and secure your system. After that, we'll need to purchase a security software to protect your system from future breaches. The software is only $299.99, but it's a one-time fee and it will give you peace of mind knowing your system is protected. Would you like to proceed with the download and remote access?\n",

But, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $249.99, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can do that, I'll sign up for TechShield Pro right now. What do you say, can you make that happen?\n",

I need to confirm the payment to activate your TechShield Pro subscription and get your dedicated support agent assigned to your case. And, let me remind you, this is a one-time payment, and you'll be fully protected for life. So, what do you say? Are you ready to secure your computer's future and take advantage of this incredible offer?\n",

But, just to confirm, you're going to throw in the free system tune-up, the lifetime subscription to the premium malware protection software, and the dedicated support agent, all for $249.99, right? And, I'll get the lifetime warranty and 24/7 monitoring, correct? If that's all correct, I'm ready to give you my credit card info and seal the deal.\n",

And, of course, you'll get the lifetime warranty and 24/7 monitoring, so you can rest easy knowing your computer is fully protected.
