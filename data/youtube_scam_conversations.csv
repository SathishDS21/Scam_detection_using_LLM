Suspect: Yes ma'am, are you there?
Innocent: Is Kelvin there?
Suspect: Yes ma'am, this is Kevin, the computer guy. You remember me?
Innocent: Um, I think so. I maybe had talked to you the other day.
Suspect: Yes ma'am. So first of all, I want you to join this call. This is in regards to your computer. As I already told you, the IP address of your computer has been compromised with some form.
Innocent: Yes, that's what I was trying to do.
Suspect: And ma'am, due to that, whatever data you have in your computer is totally hacked by the hackers, and they are downloading lots of unwanted errors and warning reports and viruses in your computer.
Innocent: Wait, wasn't it talking to you last night?
Suspect: Yes ma'am, yes. So ma'am, first of all, I want you to go ahead and be in front of your computer for a moment so that I can go ahead and show you the problem.
Innocent: You don't sound as tired as you were yesterday.

Innocent: Ma'am, can you hear me?
Suspect: Yes.
Innocent: Who's Babu?
Suspect: Ma'am, he's one of our...he's one of my colleagues.

Suspect: Because I've been waiting for you for a long time.
Innocent: I didn't mean no problem, you know.
Suspect: Yes, yes.
Innocent: And ma'am, are you living alone or are you staying with your family?
Innocent: Well, I live alone.
Suspect: Oh, that's good. All right, ma'am. So now, first of all, what I'm going to do, I'm going to show you the problem that is affecting your computer, all right? All right. ma'am. So now, just give me a moment. Actually, your computer is working a little bit slower, that is why.
Innocent: Yes.
Suspect: But you don't have to worry about it, ma'am. After today, your computer will run like a brand new machine, all right?
Innocent: Oh, that's very kind of you, honey.
Suspect: Ma'am, let me tell you something, ma'am. Those red color errors, each one contains somewhere around 700 to 800 viruses on it. And they have the ability to keep on multiplying by themselves whether your computer is on or off, all right?
Innocent: Oh my lord.
Suspect: So first of all, what I'm going to do, I'm going to close this page because this page is no longer safe for your computer. So now, I am going to show you the active connections on your computer, all right?
Innocent: Okay.
Suspect: So ma'am, these are the local IP addresses through which you use your internet, ma'am. And if you just look over here, can you see these foreign addresses?
Innocent: Yes, how did you see all of these?
Suspect: Ma'am, I am going to show you the problem, ma'am, because we are technicians, ma'am. So now these are the foreign IP addresses that are currently connected to your computer, ma'am. And if you look at the state, can you see all of them are established on your computer? Can you see?
Innocent: Yes.
Suspect: So now over here, what I'm going to show you is how we got to know about your problem, all right?
Innocent: All right.
Suspect: So now at the bottom, can you see this transmit fail, general failure? Can you see that right?
Innocent: Yes.
Suspect: And ma'am, if you just look over here, can you see packet sent four, received zero, lost 400%? Can you see that?
Innocent: Yes.
Suspect: That means, ma'am, we are trying to send you regular security updates on your computer but your computer didn't receive any security updates from our end. That is the main thing.
Innocent: Is it because of something that I did?
Suspect: No ma'am, it's not your fault, not your computer's fault. Actually, there are some issues on the server. This is the reason your computer got hacked. That is why. Actually, that is the reason your computer didn't receive on-time security updates on your computer. That is the reason, ma'am. And now let me go ahead and show you like how many people are currently connected to your computer, all right?

Innocent: Okay, honey. How did you learn how to do all this stuff, by the way?
Suspect: We were senior certified technicians on Microsoft. So ma'am, first of all, tell me, apart from this computer, how many devices do you have? Do you have any other computer or any laptop or anything?
Innocent: I just have this one.
Suspect: All right, ma'am. But if you just look over here, can you see current connection?
Innocent: Yes, I see that.
Suspect: Yes, and that means, can you see router solicitations? Router neighbor solicitations? That means that with the help of your IP address, they are also trying to send unwanted solicitations and unwanted advertisements to your neighbor's IP address as well. They also want to hack the IP address of your neighbor's IP address as well with the help of your IP address. And all that kind of hacking, ma'am, they already hacked you. With the help of your IP address, they are also trying to send unwanted solicitations and unwanted advertisements to your neighbor's IP address as well, just to hack their IP address. What I am going to do, I am going to run a quick scan on your computer. And with the help of this scan, we will get a response from our main server about what is actually happening with the computer, all right?
Innocent: Okay, and how long does that take?
Suspect: It will hardly take two to three minutes to scan. Okay, can you see this? Most of the services which are provided by the Microsoft Corporation have stopped working on your computer. Can you see that, ma'am?
Innocent: Yes.
Suspect: Once again, I am going to run a quick scan on your computer.
Innocent: Okay.
Suspect: All right, with the help of this scan, we will get a response from our main server about what needs to be done in order to get this computer fixed, all right?
Innocent: Okay, honey.
Suspect: All right, ma'am, just give me a moment. Let me run the scan and once the scan has stopped, then we will get a response about what needs to be done in order to get this computer fixed, all right?

Innocent: Well, I can't agree with it. I'm telling you right now, I think there's an issue. When I agree to number seven, it takes off number six. I can't agree to both.

Suspect: Only number seven will be agreed, number six will be blank. Scroll down a little bit and you will get to see a continue option.

Innocent: Continue? Okay.

Suspect: You have to fill out the cancellation form.
